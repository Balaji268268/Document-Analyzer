"""Background workers for the Qt UI.

Long operations (model load, download, summarize, batch) run on a
``QThreadPool`` so the UI thread stays responsive. A worker never touches QML
directly — it reports back via signals, which Qt delivers on the receiver's
(UI) thread. Mirrors the threading discipline of the old CustomTkinter
controller (``self.after(0, ...)``), but with Qt's queued signal/slot delivery.
